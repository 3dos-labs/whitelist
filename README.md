# List of Whitelisted Marketplaces

Welcome to the 3DOS Extension! This extension is a key component of our broader effort to build a **global, decentralized manufacturing network**. Below, you’ll find important details about how the extension works, which websites are whitelisted, and how you can earn bonus reward points by browsing and contributing to this movement.

---

## Overview

- **Decentralized Vision**: Our goal is to create a decentralized manufacturing network that taps into idle production capacity around the world. By mapping manufacturing-related data, we’re enabling faster, more efficient, and more sustainable manufacturing processes.
- **Whitelisted Websites**: The 3DOS Extension only operates on whitelisted websites—specifically, major marketplaces around the globe. These top marketplaces offer publicly available data, which the extension uses to gather insights about manufacturing capacity.

---

## How It Works

1. **Install**: Once you install the 3DOS Extension, it remains dormant on sites that aren’t whitelisted.  
2. **Browse**: When you visit a supported marketplace, the extension identifies and collects publicly available manufacturing-related information (e.g., potential production capabilities, equipment listings).  
3. **Map Global Capacity**: Collected data is anonymized and helps inform the 3DOS network about where and how manufacturing capacity can be used locally on-demand.  
4. **Earn Points**: By browsing the whitelisted sites, you contribute to the decentralized ecosystem—and, in return, you’ll earn **bonus reward points** in the 3DOS network.

## Whitelisted Websites

A list of major marketplaces (subject to updates) is maintained in our [Whitelisted Sites Repository](https://github.com/3dos-labs/whitelist/blob/main/whiteList.json). Only these websites enable the data collection feature. We limit data collection to publicly available information on these sites to protect privacy and respect each platform’s policies.

---

## Why Whitelist?

- **Privacy & Compliance**: Restricting the extension to these marketplaces ensures data collection is focused, transparent, and lawful.  
- **Efficiency**: Gathering relevant manufacturing capacity information from top websites helps us build a robust database for the 3DOS network, without burdening users or collecting unnecessary data.

## Earning Bonus Points

- **Daily Browsing**: Each day you visit whitelisted websites, you’ll earn additional 3DOS reward points for contributing critical data to the network.  
- **Active Contributions**: Active participants—those who regularly visit sites, provide feedback, or share new marketplace suggestions—may receive extra bonuses.

---

## Future Updates

We’re constantly evolving:
- **Expanding Whitelisted Sites**: We plan to add more marketplaces based on community suggestions.  
- **Improved Data Mapping**: Ongoing improvements to data mapping will give users deeper insights and enhance the global manufacturing capacity map.  
- **Community Governance**: Expect more decentralized governance features, so community members can help shape network policies and expansion.
